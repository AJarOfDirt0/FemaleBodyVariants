This mod provides a way to load, on the fly, a different body texture for thin, fat and hulk females. 
It will use these names:

Naked_Thin_Female_south.png
Naked_Thin_Female_east.png
Naked_Thin_Female_north.png

Naked_Fat_Female_east.png
Naked_Fat_Female_north.png
Naked_Fat_Female_south.png

Naked_Hulk_Female_east.png
Naked_Hulk_Female_north.png
Naked_Hulk_Female_south.png

I made a simple copy of the original textures for this mod so it won't try to load a texture that doesn't exists.
So this mod be itself won't change anything visually, but in conjunction with a texture mode that contains the files above you will be able to see the female variation of those three body types.

Anyone is free to use mod as a pre requisite for your own mod or copy the dll to your own mod.

As I'm making a body retexture mod I will have this mod as a pre requisite for my future mod.

Might not be compatible with HAR, if you are using HAR you probably don't need this anyway.
